# HTTP integration

Use this route only when the target application cannot use the Python client. Reuse the target project's existing HTTP library and add one small typed adapter.

## Connection

Default base URL:

```text
https://www.reflexio.ai
```

Do not add a URL setting for the default path. Only use a different base URL when the user explicitly supplies or requests an override.

For Hosted Enterprise or an authenticated custom endpoint, send these headers:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <REFLEXIO_API_KEY>
Content-Type: application/json
User-Agent: <application-name>-reflexio
```

If the developer explicitly requested a default unauthenticated Local OSS endpoint, omit only the `Authorization` header.

Keep a bounded timeout. Inspect the HTTP status and raw response body before diagnosing authentication, routing, or schema failures. Never log the bearer token.

## Search before agent execution

```http
POST /api/search
```

```json
{
  "query": "the user's current request",
  "user_id": "stable-user-id",
  "session_id": "stable-session-id",
  "agent_version": "support-agent@2",
  "entity_types": ["profiles", "user_playbooks", "agent_playbooks"],
  "agent_playbook_status_filter": ["approved"],
  "top_k": 3
}
```

The successful response contains `profiles`, `user_playbooks`, and `agent_playbooks`. Render each type separately and retain these IDs:

| Result | Stable ID | Publish kind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Profile | `profile_id` | `profile` |
| User playbook | `user_playbook_id` | `user_playbook` |
| Agent playbook | `agent_playbook_id` | `agent_playbook` |

Convert numeric playbook IDs to strings when creating `retrieved_learnings`.

## Publish after the response completes

```http
POST /api/publish_interaction
```

```json
{
  "user_id": "stable-user-id",
  "session_id": "stable-session-id",
  "source": "support-agent:v2",
  "agent_version": "support-agent@2",
  "interaction_data_list": [
    {
      "role": "User",
      "content": "the user's current request"
    },
    {
      "role": "Agent",
      "content": "the completed agent response",
      "retrieved_learnings": [
        {"kind": "profile", "learning_id": "profile-id"},
        {"kind": "agent_playbook", "learning_id": "42"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`request_id` is optional correlation metadata, not an idempotency key. Current replay detection is not atomic, so repeated or concurrent submissions can still reject or duplicate work. Do not rely on a caller-supplied value to make an ambiguous replay safe.

Use the same identity values as search. Treat permanent `4xx` validation failures as rejected publishes. A timeout, connection loss, or `5xx` is ambiguous because the server may have accepted the request before the response was lost; quarantine that batch for reconciliation rather than automatically replaying it. Retry only when the host can prove the server did not accept the request. Keep failures observable without replacing a valid agent response.

## Read-only connection check

```http
GET /api/whoami
```

Use the same headers. A successful identity response verifies the endpoint and API key without publishing customer or synthetic interaction data.
