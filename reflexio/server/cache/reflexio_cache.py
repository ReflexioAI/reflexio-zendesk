    """Per-org cache entry pairing a Reflexio instance with the config version stamped at load time.

    The ``cached_version`` is whatever ``Reflexio.current_config_version()``
    returned when the instance was constructed. On each cache hit we
    re-probe and evict the entry if the value changed — this catches
    out-of-band config mutations (file edits, sibling-replica writes,
    direct DB updates) that don't go through ``invalidate_reflexio_cache``.

    Attributes:
        reflexio (Reflexio): The cached Reflexio instance.
        cached_version (tuple[str, Any] | None): The version stamp
            captured at load time. ``None`` means "no probe available";
            entries with ``None`` are never auto-evicted (they fall
            through to the TTL safety net). Probe failures during
            construction never produce ``None`` here — they're recorded
            as the same value the next probe attempt would compare
            against, so a later successful probe can still evict the
            stale entry.
