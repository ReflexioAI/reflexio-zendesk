"""Process-local scheduler for lineage tombstone garbage collection and expiry reclamation.

Startup runs when EITHER ``lineage_gc.enabled`` OR ``expiry_reclamation.enabled``
OR ``governance_retention.audit_events_retention_enabled`` is set in the bootstrap
org's config. Each tick evaluates every org independently.

- **Class A** (profile expiry sweep + tombstone GC): gated on ``lineage_gc.enabled``.
  Hard-deletes expired tombstones per that org's ``lineage_gc`` config.
- **Class B** (plain-row direct-delete sweeps, no PII/audit obligation): gated on
  ``expiry_reclamation.enabled``. Currently sweeps expired share links and expired
  pending tool calls.
- **Per-org sweeps**: registered via :func:`register_per_org_sweep`; invoked
  unconditionally once per org after the Class-B block. Enterprise registers a
  governance-retention closure here at startup (see ``reflexio_ext``).

One org's failure never stalls the loop; errors are captured as anomalies
and the loop continues to the next org.

Note: the poll interval is always taken from ``lineage_gc.poll_interval_seconds``
even when only ``expiry_reclamation`` or ``governance_retention`` is enabled;
all sweep classes share that cadence.

    Startup runs when the bootstrap-org config sets ``lineage_gc.enabled``
    (Class A: profile expiry + tombstone GC), ``expiry_reclamation.enabled``
    (Class B: plain-row direct-delete sweeps), or
    ``governance_retention.audit_events_retention_enabled`` — OR when any sweep
    hook has been registered via :func:`register_per_org_sweep` /
    :func:`register_global_sweep`. Registered hooks carry their own per-org gate
    in the enterprise closure, so the scheduler must start to evaluate them even
    when none of the bootstrap-org flags are set. Returns ``None`` only if none
    of these conditions hold.

    Tombstone-GC enablement criteria (must ALL hold before enabling ``lineage_gc``
    for a production org):

    1. **Mechanism**: GC ages tombstones by ``retired_at`` (the INTEGER epoch
       written at every tombstone write-path).  Rows with ``retired_at = NULL``
       (created before the column was added) are never eligible and are retained.
    2. **Grace window**: 90 days is the vetted default (``tombstone_grace_window_days``).
       This is a per-deployment policy knob — do not shorten without reviewing
       PII-lifetime obligations (GDPR Art. 5(1)(e)) and audit-depth requirements.
    3. **B2↔B3 timing gate**: enable per-org only once the grace window is ≥ the
       reconstruction read-back horizon used by B3 changelog replay, OR once B3 is
       fully shipped and the horizon is confirmed.  Enabling before this point risks
       GC'ing tombstones the B3 replay still needs.
    4. **DPO sign-off**: obtain sign-off on the PII-lifetime and audit-depth
       implications before enabling in any deployment that processes personal data.

    Note: the poll cadence is always controlled by ``lineage_gc.poll_interval_seconds``
    even when only ``expiry_reclamation`` is enabled; Class B shares that interval.

    Args:
        request_context_factory: Builds an org-scoped :class:`RequestContext`.
        bootstrap_org_id: Org used to read config and seed cross-org discovery.
        org_id_provider: Optional tenant-enumerating org-id source. When ``None``
            (OSS default), falls back to the module-level provider hook set via
            :func:`set_org_id_provider`; when both are ``None`` discovery uses
            ``storage.list_org_ids()`` exactly as before.
        leader_gate: Optional fleet-coordination gate. When ``None`` (OSS
            default), falls back to the module-level hook set via
            :func:`set_leader_gate`; when both are ``None`` the scheduler ticks
            unconditionally (today's behavior).
