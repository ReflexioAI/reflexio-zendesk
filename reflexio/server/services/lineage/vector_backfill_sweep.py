"""Missing-vector backfill sweep for the shared ``LineageGCScheduler``.

When an embedding call fails or degrades, the ingest path stores an empty
embedding (and writes no vector row), returns success, and nothing ever
re-embeds the row — so that interaction is invisible to vector/hybrid search
forever. This is a latent durability hole. This module registers a bounded,
idempotent, per-org sweep that re-embeds those interactions on the shared GC
scheduler cadence.

Design:

- **Per-org**: registered via :func:`register_per_org_sweep`, so it runs once
  per org per tick with the org id supplied by the scheduler (the ``(org_id,
  now) -> int`` seam). The global ``register_global_sweep`` seam only passes
  ``now`` and cannot drive a per-org backfill, so it is the wrong hook here.
- **Bounded**: re-embeds at most ``REFLEXIO_MISSING_VECTOR_BACKFILL_CAP``
  interactions per org per tick (prior art warns unbounded backfills flood
  logs / embedding cost — see ``llm/_litellm_embedding.py``).
- **On by default**: registered unless ``REFLEXIO_MISSING_VECTOR_BACKFILL_ENABLED``
  is explicitly falsey. It was opt-in originally so that a deployment which had
  not asked for it was byte-for-byte unchanged; that turned out to be the wrong
  default, because the hole it repairs is opened silently by the ingest path and
  is permanent while nothing sweeps. An operator who wants the old behaviour
  sets the flag to ``false``. The flag is re-read every tick, so a live disable
  is honoured without a restart.

  Registering any per-org hook starts the shared ``LineageGCScheduler`` even
  when no bootstrap-org flag is set, so this default also starts that loop where
  it previously would not have. Other sweep classes keep their own config gates
  and do not begin running as a result -- only this hook does.
- **Fail-safe**: the storage layer catches ``EmbeddingUnavailableError`` and
  returns 0 (work left for the next tick); this closure additionally captures
  any unexpected error as an anomaly and returns the count so far, so one org's
  failure never stalls the shared loop.
- **Idempotent**: once an interaction's vector is written it no longer matches
  detection and is skipped next tick.
