"""Temporal post-processing for search results.

Applies query-derived temporal signals (extracted by the query reformulator
alongside the rewrite — see ``ReformulationResult``) to ranked entity lists:

- ``window_bounds``: relative day offsets → absolute datetimes for the
  per-arm ``start_time``/``end_time`` SQL filters.
- ``freshness_collapse``: within near-duplicate groups of competing facts,
  the freshest wins — deterministically fixing "stale fact with the same
  wording outranks its fresh update", which LLM ordering alone misses.
- ``sort_by_recency``: absolute timestamp ordering for "current/latest X"
  questions.
