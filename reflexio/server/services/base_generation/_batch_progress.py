"""Batch-progress + rerun orchestration for ``BaseGenerationService`` (Tier-1b decomposition).

``BatchProgressMixin`` holds the shared batch-with-progress driver
(``_run_batch_with_progress``) plus the ``run_rerun`` public template method and the
overridable rerun hooks subclasses implement (``_get_rerun_user_ids``,
``_build_rerun_request_params``, ``_create_run_request_for_item``,
``_create_rerun_response``, ``_get_generated_count``, ``_pre_process_rerun``).

``_run_batch_with_progress`` is both subclass-called (``self._run_batch_with_progress``
in the profile/playbook manual-run paths, resolved via MRO) and instance-patched in
tests (``patch.object(svc, "_run_batch_with_progress")``, which is location-agnostic).
It is the sole WRITER of ``self._is_batch_mode`` (read by the base ``run``); that field
is initialised on the base ``__init__`` and stubbed annotation-only below. ``run_rerun``
is PUBLIC (dispatched via ``run_method="run_rerun"`` from ``lib/_generation.py``) so its
signature is byte-identical. Method bodies are moved VERBATIM from the former monolithic
``base_generation_service.py``.
