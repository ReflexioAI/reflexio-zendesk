        When an embedding call fails or degrades, the ingest path stores an empty

        Returns ``(interaction_id, embed_text)`` pairs where ``embed_text`` is

        byte-for-byte comparable to a freshly-ingested one.

        Fail-safe: if the embedder is unavailable the implementation must skip
