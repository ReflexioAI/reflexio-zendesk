"""Shared pure helpers for retrieved-learning evaluation state.

Used by every storage backend (SQLite, Supabase, native Postgres) and by the
group-evaluation runner, so this module must stay free of storage imports.

Concurrency model (no mutation-site instrumentation):

- The **session fingerprint** is a SHA-256 digest over every interaction ID in
  the session plus each interaction's canonical attachment refs. Any
  interaction publish or delete changes it (autoincrement interaction IDs make
  ABA collisions unrealizable), so it covers transcript-only changes as well
  as attachment changes.
- Each evaluation run receives a monotonically increasing **generation**
  allocated in ``_operation_state``. Replacement CASes generation and a
  fingerprint recomputed under the replacement transaction's lock, so an
  older or stale snapshot cannot overwrite newer session state.
