        This method should use atomic operations to either:

           ``pending_request_queue`` if an active lock is held by another
           request. Duplicates (same ``request_id`` already queued, or matching
           the current holder) are dropped to keep the queue idempotent under
           publish retries.

        The queue is a FIFO drained one entry at a time when the holder

        ``pending_request_id`` field, which silently dropped earlier blocked

        written for one release window so a server upgrade in flight can be
        drained by either code path.
