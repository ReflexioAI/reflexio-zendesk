            ever evaluated session for this org. None when no results exist.
        n_shadow_in_window (int): Count of evaluation results that have a
            shadow grade inside the trend window. Caller is responsible for
            filtering; this function only consumes the count.
            Why graded-only: prevents the FULL gate from tripping mid-window-
            flag-flip when sessions exist with shadow_content but no shadow
            grade. (Note: the direct-grade `shadow_is_success` /
            `shadow_is_escalated` columns added briefly in May 2026 were
            retracted before any production deploy — see the deleted
            migration pair in supabase/data/tenant/. The
            per-turn shadow grade in F1 lives on a different surface.)
        total_results (int): Total AgentSuccessEvaluationResult rows in the
            trend window, used to distinguish EMPTY from states with data.

    Returns:
        HeroState: The single applicable state. Empty wins over everything;
            after that the order is shadow_off → early → full per spec.
