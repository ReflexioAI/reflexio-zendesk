"""Shared thread-lifecycle base for the process-local polling schedulers.

Reflexio runs a family of background daemons — extraction resume, lineage GC,
and (in the enterprise layer) billing ship / lease / period-close / integrity /
audit / offline-tuner / governance-retention. Every one
of them hand-rolled the SAME thread mechanics: a :class:`threading.Event`
stop-signal, a daemon :class:`threading.Thread` running a ``while not
stop.is_set()`` loop, and a ``.join(timeout)`` graceful stop.

:class:`ThreadedScheduler` captures ONLY those mechanics. Each scheduler keeps
its own poll interval, work body, gating, and log lines — supplied via a small
set of hooks so no observable behaviour changes:

- :meth:`_run_once` performs one tick (catching its own errors) and returns the
  number of seconds to wait before the next tick. A scheduler that reads its
  interval from config each tick keeps doing exactly that by returning the fresh
  value.
- :meth:`_should_start` can veto startup (the enterprise schedulers whose
  ``start`` is a logged no-op when a feature gate is off).
- :meth:`_on_started` / :meth:`_on_stopped` emit each scheduler's own start/stop
  log line (through its own module logger, so output is byte-identical).
- ``leader_gate`` (optional): a fleet-coordination gate consulted before each
  tick; ``None`` (the default and the OSS-local case) preserves today's
  always-tick behavior byte-for-byte.

A scheduler whose loop is materially different (e.g. a bounded-attempt retrier
that waits *before* each attempt and exits on first success) may override
:meth:`_run_loop` wholesale and still reuse :meth:`start` / :meth:`stop` /
:meth:`is_running`.

This module is an OSS public seam: it imports only the standard library and
nothing from ``reflexio_ext``.
