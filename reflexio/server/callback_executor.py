"""Process-wide bounded executor for deferred fire-and-forget callbacks.

Replaces thread-per-fire in the debounce schedulers (tagging, group
evaluation, playbook optimization) so thread count is O(1) instead of
O(active keys) (spec section 6.2). Sizes are module constants, not env vars.

Overflow policy: drop-oldest (a dropped fire is a stale debounced trigger —
the next event for that key re-creates it) with one warning log per drop and
a throttled anomaly when drops exceed ``_DROP_RATE_PER_MINUTE`` in a rolling
minute (the "this is routine, resize it" signal).
