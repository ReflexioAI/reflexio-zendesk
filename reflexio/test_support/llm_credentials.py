"""Provider-credential floor for the OS and enterprise test suites.

Service constructors resolve their default model eagerly — e.g.
``AgentSuccessEvaluator.__init__`` and ``SQLiteStorage.__init__`` both call
``model_defaults.resolve_model_name``, which raises ``RuntimeError: No LLM
provider available`` when the environment carries no provider key. Unit and
integration tests never make a real call (``litellm.completion`` is patched
globally) but they still run through those constructors, so on a machine with
no credentials the suites collapse at fixture setup rather than testing
anything.

A developer machine hides this: ``./.env``, ``~/.reflexio/.env``, and litellm's
import-time dotenv walk-up all feed real keys into ``os.environ``. CI has none,
which is why the same suite can be green locally and ~1,250 errors deep in CI.
