"""Boundary validation for publish payloads.

Regression suite for a class of silent data loss: a publish whose interaction
objects never bound was accepted with 200 and stored rows with ``content=''``,
producing no learnings and no error anywhere. Three defects combined to hide it:

1. Every ``InteractionData`` field has a default and unknown keys were ignored
   with no trace, so a mis-keyed ``content`` yielded a valid empty interaction.
2. The precondition guard meant to catch empty interactions was dead code
   (truthiness test against a truthy ``StrEnum`` member).
3. On the default async path the precondition result is discarded entirely.

The per-interaction rules therefore live on the request model, which is the
only layer that fires on both the sync and the background-task path.

Unknown keys stay silently ignored here, deliberately. Rejecting them was
implemented and reverted -- it broke every first-party plugin publish -- and
*reporting* them to the caller is a separate change; this one fixes the
incident.
