"""Guard the forwarding contract between the two text-generation entry points.

``generate_chat_response`` and ``generate_chat_response_with_provenance`` share a
copy-pasted block that forwards optional keyword arguments into ``_make_request``.
When a new option is added to one and the forwarding line is pasted into the other
without also adding the parameter, the result is a ``NameError`` that only fires at
runtime, on the exact call path that uses it.

That happened in production: ``provider_request_guard`` was added to
``generate_chat_response`` and its forwarding block pasted into
``generate_chat_response_with_provenance``, whose signature never gained the
parameter. Every tool-loop call raised
``NameError: name 'provider_request_guard' is not defined``, which surfaced as
"Playbook extraction failed without structured output".

The signature-parity test below fails on any future instance of that class; the
call test pins the specific regression.
