"""Positive control: must-capture manifest families survive the live reviewer.

Every other reviewer test mocks the LLM, so none of them can detect a prompt
change that makes the model reject good candidates. That gap has bitten: a
reviewer check was written whose disqualifier list textually contradicted the
prompt's own "Useful cores to preserve" section, and every unit test passed --
the contradiction was only visible by reading the two sections side by side.

Window-based measurement did not cover it either, because the production windows
sampled happened to contain no candidate of the affected shape. This test closes
that by driving the reviewer with the repo's own generalization manifest: each
`must_capture` case becomes one candidate, grounded in that case's own turns. A
must-capture family that does not survive is a false rejection.

Costs real API calls. It lives under `e2e_tests/` because that is the only path
`llm_mock._is_e2e_test_run` exempts from the session-wide `litellm.completion`
patch -- from anywhere else the reviewer answers from the mock's profile-shaped
payload, the schema fails to parse, and the repair ladder exhausts into twelve
failures that look like a reviewer regression and are not.

Run it when changing the reviewer prompt:

    set -a && source .env && set +a && \\
    RUN_LOW_PRIORITY=1 uv run pytest \\
      tests/e2e_tests/test_reviewer_manifest_regression_real_llm.py -o 'addopts=' -n 0 -v
